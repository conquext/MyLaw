# Backend Challenge

Mylaw Confrence is looking for someone to design a RESTful API for talks at a conference.

## Requirements:

- Demonstrate use of REST conventions
- Include routes to:
  - add a talk
  - add an attendee
  - add an attendee to a talk
- Design a simple (not necessarily beautiful) user interface with framework/library of your choice to consume the API.
- Put solution on GitHub/BitBucket or any Git Server
- Upload to webserver of choice e.g Heruko, Zeit, Netlify, AWS, or Digital Ocean

## Bonuses:

- Use appropriate HTTP status codes.
- Include a route to remove a talk.

## What we are looking out for?

- Ability to understand the problem and work out a creative solution
- Your code standard (function names, variable names, separation of concerns)
- Your Git Commits
- As much as a good design catches the eye, we are not judging you on that, rather the functionality.
